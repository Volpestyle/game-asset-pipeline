## Model readme

> # Veo 3.1
> 
> Google's state-of-the-art video generation model that creates high-quality videos with synchronized native audio from text prompts or images. Veo 3.1 offers enhanced prompt adherence, improved audiovisual quality, and powerful creative controls for image-to-video generation.
> 
> ## Key Features
> 
> **Synchronized Audio Generation** – Veo 3.1 generates rich native audio automatically, from natural conversations and sound effects to ambient soundscapes, perfectly synchronized with your video content.
> 
> **Enhanced Image-to-Video** – Transform static images into dynamic videos with superior prompt adherence and visual quality. Veo 3.1 excels at maintaining character consistency and understanding your creative vision.
> 
> **Superior Prompt Understanding** – The model demonstrates remarkable comprehension of complex, nuanced prompts including intricate scenes, specific camera movements, and detailed artistic styles that previous models often missed.
> 
> **Realistic Physics and Motion** – Veo 3.1 delivers true-to-life textures, coherent motion across frames, and improved realism capturing natural movement and interactions.
> 
> **Reference Image Support** – Upload up to 3 reference images to guide the appearance, style, and character consistency across your generated video, ensuring visual continuity throughout.
> 
> **Frame-to-Frame Generation** – Provide a starting and ending frame, and Veo 3.1 generates smooth, seamless transitions between them, perfect for creating artful scene transitions.
> 
> **Multiple Output Formats** – Generate videos at 720p or 1080p resolution at 24 FPS, with support for both landscape (16:9) and portrait (9:16) aspect ratios. Choose from 4, 6, or 8-second durations.
> 
> **Cinematic Quality** – Veo 3.1 incorporates enhanced understanding of cinematic styles and narrative control, delivering more polished and professional-looking results.
> 
> ## What You Can Create
> 
> **Text-to-Video** – Describe your vision in natural language and watch it come to life with synchronized audio. From realistic scenes to fantastical concepts, Veo 3.1 translates your words into stunning visuals.
> 
> **Image-to-Video** – Animate your static images with lifelike motion and accompanying audio. Perfect for bringing concept art, photos, or illustrations to life.
> 
> **Character Consistency** – Maintain the same character appearance across multiple video generations using reference images, ideal for storytelling and creating cohesive content series.
> 
> **Cinematic Transitions** – Create smooth scene transitions by defining start and end frames, letting Veo 3.1 generate the motion in between with natural camera movement.
> 
> **Extended Sequences** – Build longer narratives by chaining multiple generations together, with each new clip seamlessly continuing from where the last one ended.
> 
> ## Best Practices
> 
> **Crafting Effective Prompts** – Be specific and descriptive in your text prompts. Include details about camera angles, lighting, mood, and any audio elements you want. For example: "A medium shot of a wise owl circling above a moonlit forest clearing, with wings flapping sounds and a gentle orchestral score."
> 
> **Using Reference Images** – When using reference images for character or style consistency, choose clear, well-lit images that show the subject from the desired angle. You can provide 1-3 images to guide the generation.
> 
> **Image-to-Video Tips** – For best results with image-to-video, use high-quality input images with clear subjects. Your prompt should describe the motion and action you want to see, not just describe what's already in the image.
> 
> **Audio Considerations** – While Veo 3.1 generates synchronized audio automatically, you can guide it by describing desired sounds in your prompt using tags or descriptions like "with bird songs and wind rustling" or "accompanied by upbeat music."
> 
> **Frame Control** – When using start and end frames, ensure they're visually compatible and the transition you're requesting is physically plausible. The model works best with natural motion sequences.
> 
> ## About Veo 3.1
