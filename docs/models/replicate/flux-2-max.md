## Basic model info

Model name: black-forest-labs/flux-2-max
Model description: The highest fidelity image model from Black Forest Labs


## Model inputs

- prompt (required): Text prompt for image generation (string)
- input_images (optional): List of input images for image-to-image generation. Maximum 8 images. Must be jpeg, png, gif, or webp. (array)
- aspect_ratio (optional): Aspect ratio for the generated image. Use 'match_input_image' to match the first input image's aspect ratio. (string)
- resolution (optional): Resolution in megapixels. Up to 4 MP is possible, but 2 MP or below is recommended. The maximum image size is 2048x2048, which means that high-resolution images may not respect the resolution if aspect ratio is not 1:1.

Resolution is not used when aspect_ratio is 'custom'. When aspect_ratio is 'match_input_image', use 'match_input_image' to match the input image's resolution (clamped to 0.5-4 MP). (string)
- width (optional): Width of the generated image. Only used when aspect_ratio=custom. Must be a multiple of 32 (if it's not, it will be rounded to nearest multiple of 32). (integer)
- height (optional): Height of the generated image. Only used when aspect_ratio=custom. Must be a multiple of 32 (if it's not, it will be rounded to nearest multiple of 32). (integer)
- safety_tolerance (optional): Safety tolerance, 1 is most strict and 5 is most permissive (integer)
- seed (optional): Random seed. Set for reproducible generation (integer)
- output_format (optional): Format of the output images. (string)
- output_quality (optional): Quality when saving the output images, from 0 to 100. 100 is best quality, 0 is lowest quality. Not relevant for .png outputs (integer)
